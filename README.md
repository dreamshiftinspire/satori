An easy to use collective experience of support and connection with oneself and with others around the world.
What the project does: Video record/recall/playback/time capsule library archive, video randomizer, member profile logins, therapy/coaching/support services referral database.
Why the project is useful: Elevates the human experience of inter-connectedness in what has become more disconnected eart through curiosity, self-inquiry & support and community interconnectedness with a library archive of people around the world sharing vulnerable truths from their hearts to themselves and witnessing the positive impact everyone has on each other (shift out of superficial, degrading, and anxiety producing experiences in the world)
How users can get started with the project:  Help with template codes or writing codes for each of the elements above along with security and redundancy to help ensure these videos are securely maintained in some form for the next 100+ years, preserved as a historical documentation of our time, of how we uplift one another, together.
Where users can get help with your project:  Will be uploading a lucidchart of the structure and flow diagram of what I've laid out over the past several years.
Who maintains and contributes to the project: Aliss Wang, this community, and you.
Thank you for making a difference in someone's life, and for our future's future.
